  Object Hunt Unity
</h1>

# Intro
This is an attemp to recreate a finding hidden object game such as [Find It Out - Hidden Object](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=find.out.hidden.objects.seek.puzzle.games.free) or [Hidden Though Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CrazyMonkeyStudios.Hidden&hl=en_US). This project does not only have gameplay logic but also provide you with an editor tool for creating multiple levels for the game in a short amount of time.

## How to install the project
Open the current project folder using Unity 2022 LTS version. For the specific Unity version required for the current project, please check this file:  [ProjectVersion](ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt). In theory, any Unity 2022 LTS version should work. You can also try a lower version to see if it builds (2021 LTS should work as well). 

## Editor Tool guides
  - Guide for creating level tool can be found [here]()

## Features to be added in the future
  - Gameplay features: complete the gameflow, add more decorations to the map, implement addressable for level resources...
  - Editor tool features: add tool to mass produce hidden object in each level, also add a same tool for level decorations, improve the convenient of current tools...
